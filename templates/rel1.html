                    Garba is a type of Indian dance that is commonly performed at festivals and special occasions. It is a dance that involves moving from side to side as the dancer traces a larger circular pattern with other people. Garba celebrates womanhood and pays respect to many mother goddesses.

                    The most prominent time that Hindus perform Garba is during the nine-day long Navratri festival. During this nine-day festival, large groups of Hindus will gather in halls, gymnasiums, and other spacious areas to participate in Garba together. These get-togethers happen in Hindu communities in a multitude of countries around the world. Garba allows Hindus to come together with their religious community in order to participate in a ritual that is special to them.

                    Puja usually involves offering fruit or flowers to an image or a miniature statue of god. Although there are many forms of Puja that can take place, itâ€™s main purpose is to be used as a means to worship God. Puja is a ritual that allows Hindus to create an emotional connection with the divine.
